rotatris-oplog
================

##What is it

  This is a small game created during my studies. It shows what is possible with new technologies like websockets, WebGL,   Node.js and communication between smartphones and your desktopbrowser. 
  This project was originally designed with pure Node.js. I ported this project to meteor.js because of the new oplog queries. These queries dont use polling to detect if the data changes. I tried to
  find out how potential this new queries are and how can they be used for games. Checkout the Node.js project if you want to compare the performance yourself: https://github.com/Chaosbohne/rotatetris
